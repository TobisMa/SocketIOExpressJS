# How to start
Install npm following this guide: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows

Run `npm install` in the project folder on your machine
Afterwards change the name properties in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to whatever you like.

Running `npm run dev` starts the server and the server will automatically be restarted when changes are detected.

Running `npm run start` starts the server. When an error occurs the server will crash and you need to resart it. 

I recommend using `npm run dev` while programming.
